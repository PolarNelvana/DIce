<h2>HOW TO BUILD AND COMPILE:</h2>

<strong>1.) Install AutoHotkey</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>You can choose to download MPRESS as well and copy it to the Compiler folder of the AutoHotkey installation - this program will allow you to compress the EXE files to reduce their file sizes</li>
	</ul>

<strong>2.) Extract the contents of the master folder and navigate to the Bin folder</strong>

<strong>3.) Open Ahk2Exe and select "DiceHiddenSettings.ahk" as the source file (do NOT change the destination) - then press "Convert"</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>If desired, select the "Icon_40.ico" icon</li>
	<li>You can compile it to be either 32 or 64-bit</li>
	<li>You can check the "Use MPRESS" box to compress the executable and make it have a smaller file size</li>
	</ul>

<strong>4.) Extract and open the "XScreenSaverWin-master.zip" folder and follow the instructions inside to build and compile XScreenSaver</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>This may require additional software such as CMake</li>
	<li>You can compile it to be either 32 or 64-bit</li>
	<li>Copy all of the compiled contents to the Bin folder</li>
	<li>If "starwars.txt" is not in the output folder after compilation, search for it in the master folder and copy it to the Bin folder as well</li>
	</ul>

<strong>5.) Open Ahk2Exe and select "Dice.ahk" as the source file (you can set the destination to be wherever) - then press "Convert"</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>If desired, select the "Freepik.ico" icon</li>
	<li>You can compile it to be either 32 or 64-bit</li>
	<li>You can check the "Use MPRESS" box to compress the executable and make it have a smaller file size - however it may take a very long time since it is attempting to compress 80MB of data into 15MB</li>
	</ul>

<strong>Congratulations, you are now finished!</strong>
